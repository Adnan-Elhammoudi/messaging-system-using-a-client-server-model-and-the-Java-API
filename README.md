# messaging-system-using-a-client-server-model-and-the-Java-API

The server-side code accepts connections and handles several clients at the same time, every client that binds with the server establishes a new thread and a new clienthandler object and passing the socket, and streams connections and asks the client to sign up or sign in, the server read the data.out file that Includes all the information about the account and their messages to match the log-in info, and send confirmation to begin a new session to the client. The project base on composition between Account class and Messages class, every account has two array lists of messages one for inbox messages and one for the sent messages, the process of sending a message is done by searching the index of the receiver account object inside the Accounts Array list and add a new message by invoking the AddMessage method in the Account class, the search is done by the username because it is the only adjective that expresses the account, then it automatically adds this message inside the Sent Array list for his account. For every new sending process, the server-side invokes the WriteData method, itâ€™s was created so that the account information is written when needed, and to avoid creating a new ObjectOutputStram file for each new connection, the client-side duty only to send and receive the desired information that he wants to be shown after logging in successfully.
